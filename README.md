## MVP: 

* Allow a user to save information about themselves to a DB. Information should include... 

  * Name 

  * DoB 

  * Home Address 

  * Frequently visited or favorite places 

  * Umbrella Disability groupings (VI for visual impairment, ID for intellectual disability etc.) 
   ** NOTE: No specific disabling conditions for the sake of medical confidentiality.

  * Medication information 
   ** NOTE: does not need to include exact medications, use medication families instead (Anticonvulsants etc.) and medication form (Capsules etc.)

  * Certain medications may require certain considerations (injections cannot typically be taken in a public setting outside of a crisis-situation, for example) 

* Basic map of Edinburgh/Scotland

* Search bar for map (coffee shops, libraries etc.) 

* Allow users to highlight and save route of particular importance to them (workplace/family address etc.) 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## Extensions  

* Basic travel route calculator around Edinburgh/Scotland 

* Abilities to leave reviews (with scores?) on premises and services for accessibility, professionality of staff etc. 

* Route tagging based on considerations (wheelchair access, light level for VI issues etc) 

* Profile section, ability to connect with other users 

* Anything else the group feels would be worthwhile 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

### Stack Options for building (languages and applications): 

  *React

  *Vue 

  *Spring

  *MongoDB
  
  *Teams choice
