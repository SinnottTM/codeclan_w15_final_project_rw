----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


## MVP: 

* Allow a user to save information about themselves to a DB. Information should include... 

  * Name 

  * DoB 

  * Home Address 

  * Occupation 

  * Frequently visited or favorite places 

  * No disabling conditions/ for the sake of medical confidentiality but can include umbrella (VI for visual impairment, ID for intellectual disability etc.) 

  * Medication information does not need to include exact medications (again, confidentiality concerns) but can include medication families (Anticonvulsants etc.) and form (Capsules etc.).  

  * Certain medications may require certain considerations (injections cannot typically be taken in a public setting outside of a crisis-situation, for example) 

* Basic map of Edinburgh 

* Search bar for map (coffee shops, libraries etc.) 

* Allow users to highlight and save route of particular importance to them (workplace/family address etc.) 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## Extensions  

* Basic travel route calculator around Edinburgh 

* Abilities to leave reviews (with scores?) on premises and services for accessibility, professionality of staff etc. 

* Route tagging based on considerations (wheelchair access, light level for VI issues etc) 

* Profile section, ability to connect with other users 

* Anything else the group feels would be worthwhile 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
