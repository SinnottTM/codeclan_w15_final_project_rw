Build an app to assist an individual with a non-specific disability to travel on public transport. This can be specific to Edinburgh or Scotland

## MVP: 

* Allow a user to save information about themselves to a DB. Information should include... 

  * Name 

  * DoB 

  * Home Address 

  * Frequently visited or favorite places 

  * Umbrella Disability groupings (VI for visual impairment, ID for intellectual disability etc.) 
    * NOTE: No specific disabling conditions for the sake of medical confidentiality

* Basic map of Edinburgh/Scotland

* Search bar for map (Exact business names) 

* Allow users to locate and rate locations within the map area 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## Possible Extensions  

* Advanced Search bar for map (Business types, coffee shop etc.) 

* Abilities to leave reviews (with scores?) on premises and services for accessibility, professionality of staff etc. 

* Location tagging based on considerations (wheelchair access, light level for VI issues etc) 

* Profile section, ability to connect with other users

* Basic travel route calculator around Edinburgh/Scotland

* Anything else the group feels would be worthwhile
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

## Factors to consider 

* Multiple personas will need to be considered (not all disabling conditions are the same)

* App may need to strike a balance between ease of use and scope of functionality (ease of use should always win)

* Certain medications may require certain considerations (injections should not typically be taken in a public setting outside of a crisis-situation, for example), this may affect how certain users can intereact with certain businesses

* Users here will have far more direct experience in navigating their world than we will so their input/feedback is very important
